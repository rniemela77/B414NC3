1. Air > Earth
Interaction: Air particles erode or push earth particles.
Visualization: Air particles move towards earth particles and cause them to scatter or break apart.
Logic: When air particles collide with earth particles, the earth particles disperse or change position.
2. Earth > Water
Interaction: Earth particles absorb or block water particles.
Visualization: Water particles stop moving or get absorbed when they come into contact with earth particles.
Logic: When water particles collide with earth particles, they disappear, get absorbed, or stop moving.
3. Water > Fire
Interaction: Water particles extinguish fire particles.
Visualization: Water particles move towards fire particles, and the fire particles vanish.
Logic: When water particles collide with fire particles, the fire particles disappear or turn into steam.
4. Fire > Air
Interaction: Fire particles consume or strengthen with air particles.
Visualization: Fire particles grow larger or multiply when they come into contact with air particles.
Logic: When fire particles collide with air particles, the fire particles expand or multiply.
